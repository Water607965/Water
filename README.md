# 👋 Introduction 👋

Hello! These are our fun python scripts that you can experiment with as of right now!

# ⚠️ Precautions Before Installation ⚠️

1. You need to have Git installed on your computer natively on your command line or terminal.
2. There are multiple ways you can access these scripts through the amazing potential of python.
3. This will work on any desktop operating system if it can run Git (Includes MacOS, Linux, and Windows of course).

# 🆒 Execution (Download From Terminal) 🆒

🆒 Oh, so you're cool? Well I think you are since you want to download the python script on the terminal! 🆒 Here are the installation steps for the terminal (It doesn't matter which OS (Operating system) you are in):

1. Run the code in your terminal or command line: ```git clone https://github.com/Water607965/Water/tree/main``` 🗒️.
2. Run the code in your terminal or command line: ```cd water``` 🗒️.
3. Run the code in your terminal or command line: ```ls``` 🗒️.
4. You should see various python scripts. Press tab to navigate through them and choose the one, or scripts that you desire to open 🗺️.
5. Run the specified scripts in your code or text editor which will then run the script into a terminal 👏.
6. The programs will exit once you have executed the program sufficiently ✅. 

# 👍 Execution (Manual Download From Github) 👍

To successfully execute the programs, all you need to do is just follow the steps below:

1. Open the file using a text, code, or the python launcher (Note: It is best recommended to open the file within the python launcher for the best experience) 📁.
2. Press the execute button to execute the program in your editor, or just interact with the program if you are using the python launcher within your terminal or command line ⏺️.
3. The programs will exit once you have executed the program sufficiently ✅.

# 📓 Further Notes 📓

ℹ️ The source code for this project can be viewed by anyone in a code or a text editor ℹ️.

ℹ️ This is basic python code that is readily easy to interperet and is just a tiny fraction of what Water can accomplish ℹ️.

☮️ Otherwise, have a great and fun rest of your day ☮️. 🛩️ We appreciate your time here 🛩️.
