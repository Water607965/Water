# 👋 Introduction 👋

Hello! These are our fun python scripts that you can experiment with as of right now!

# 👍 Execution (Manual Download From Github) 👍

To successfully execute the programs, all you need to do is just follow the steps below:

1. Open the file using a text, code, or the python launcher (Note: It is best recommended to open the file within the python launcher for the best experience) 📁.
2. Press the execute button to execute the program in your editor, or just interact with the program if you are using the python launcher within your terminal or command line ⏺️.
3. The programs will exit once you have executed the program sufficiently ✅.

# 🆒 Execution (Download From Terminal) 🆒

🆒 Oh, so you're cool? Well I think you are since you want to download the python script on the terminal! 🆒 Here are the installation steps for the terminal (It doesn't matter which OS (Operating system) you are in):

1. Run the code in your terminal or command line: ```git clone git@github.com:Water607965/Water.git``` 🗒️.
2. Type and enter ```ls``` in the terminal or command line 🗒️.
3. You should see various python scripts. Press tab to navigate through them and choose the one, or scripts that you desire to open 🗺️.
4. Run the specified scripts in your code or text editor which will then run the script into a terminal 👏.
5. The programs will exit once you have executed the program sufficiently ✅. 

# 📓 Further Notes 📓

The source code for this project can be viewed by anyone in a code or a text editor ℹ️.

This is basic python code that is readily easy to interperet and is just a tiny fraction of what Water can accomplish ℹ️.

☮️ Otherwise, have a great and fun rest of your day ☮️. 🛩️ We appreciate your time here ℹ️.
