# 👋 Introduction 👋

Hello! These are our fun python scripts that you can experiment with as of right now!

# 👍 Execution 👍

To successfully execute the programs, all you need to do is just follow the steps below:

1. Open the file using a text, code, or the python launcher (Note: It is best recommended to open the file within the python launcher for the best experience) 📁.
2. Press the execute button to execute the program in your editor, or just interact with the program if you are using the python launcher within your terminal or command line ⏺️.
3. The programs will exit once you have executed the program sufficiently ✅.

# 📓 Further Notes 📓

The source code for this project can be viewed by anyone in a code or a text editor.

This is basic python code that is readily easy to interperet and is just a tiny fraction of what Water can accomplish.

☮️ Otherwise, have a great and fun rest of your day ☮️. 🛩️ We appreciate your time here 🛩️!
